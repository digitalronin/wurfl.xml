This is simply a repository to store the wurfl.xml file (see http://wurfl.sourceforge.net)

The purpose of this repository is to allow people to use github to view/track changes to the wurfl.xml file.

There is a change history available here;

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wurfl/files/WURFL/

But, it is incomplete, and there is no easy way to see what has changed from one version to the next.

I will try to keep this repository up to date as new wurfl snapshots are released.
